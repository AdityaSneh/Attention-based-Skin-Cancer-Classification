# Attention-based-Skin-Cancer-Classification

In clinical applications, neural networks must focus on and highlight the most important parts of an input image. Soft-Attention mechanism enables a neural network to achieve this goal. This paper investigates the effectiveness of soft-attention in deep neural architectures. The central aim of soft-attention is to boost the value of important features and suppress the noise-inducing features. We compare the performance of VGG, ResNet, Inception-ResNet-V2 and DenseNet architectures with and without the soft-attention mechanism, while classifying skin lesions.  The networks with soft-attention outperform the baseline networks and achieve a precision of 93.7% and an AUC score of 98.4% on HAM10000 dataset and an AUC score of 95.9% on ISIC-2017 dataset
